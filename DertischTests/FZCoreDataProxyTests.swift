// I may be completely wrong about this, but it seems that unit tests on code that contains references to NSPersistentContainer instances in a Cocoa Touch Framework project (like this) cannot be run as the unit test framework is incapable of finding the DB.xcdatamodeld file it needs to establish a DB connection. Keeping this file for now solely as a note of this problem.
